##  Introduction

This repo contains source code for **SimpleNet** implemented with pytorch.

SimpleNet is a simple defect detection and localization network that built with a feature encoder, feature generator and defect discriminator. It is designed conceptionally simple without complex network deisng, training schemes or external data source.

## Get Started 

### Environment 

**Python3.8**

**Packages**:
- torch==1.12.1
- torchvision==0.13.1
- numpy==1.22.4
- opencv-python==4.5.1

(Above environment setups are not the minimum requiremetns, other versions might work too.)


### Data

Point `run.sh` and `inference.sh` to your dataset root. The provided scripts expect
class subfolders with train/test splits and will automatically handle runs without
ground-truth masks.

### Run

#### Demo train

Please specify your dataset path (line1) and log folder (line10) in `run.sh` before running.

```
bash run.sh
```

#### Inference only (using a trained checkpoint)

After pointing `datapath` and `checkpoint_dir` to your environment in `inference.sh`,
run:

```
bash inference.sh
```

This evaluates a trained checkpoint on the test split and reports anomaly metrics and FPS.
